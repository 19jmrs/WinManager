# WinManager - A Windows Window Manager

I created this mini project to help me manager my windows on Windows 11.

The idea is to have a simple interface that allows me to see my current open windows and also access them through shortcuts.
One of the other cool features is the hability to reorder the windows positions by using `ctrl + arrow keys`.

To activate the WinManager you just need to press `Shift + Tab` and it will show a list of all open windows.
